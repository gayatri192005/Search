Basic web development involves the creation of websites and web applications. It includes three primary technologies:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The foundation of web development, used to structure the content of a webpage. It defines the layout using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): A styling language used to design and format the appearance of web pages. CSS controls colors, fonts, spacing, and layout, making a website visually appealing.

JavaScript: A programming language used to add interactivity and functionality to web pages. JavaScript can modify HTML and CSS, handle user inputs, create animations, and make dynamic content updates without reloading the page.
